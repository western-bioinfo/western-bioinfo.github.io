Bioinformatic methods for processing, analyzing, and integrating epigenomic data, the additional gene regulatory information beyond gene sequences. Students are introduced to best practices for quality control, regression analyses, differential analysis, and methods for functional enrichment. Data analysis will primarily use the R statistical programming language.
