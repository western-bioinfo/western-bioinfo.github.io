Technologies & Data Interpretation provides the fundamental
knowledge necessary for students to make use of state-of-the-art transcriptomic technologies and
available datasets. This course will cover currently available technologies, experimental design
considerations, obtaining publicly available data and how to analyze and interpret the results. This is a
graduate-level course offered by Western University through the Department of Biochemistry. This course
is suitable for life sciences students with interests in generating or using transcriptomic data in their
projects as well as students with backgrounds statistics, mathematics or computer science/engineering
interested in developing new methods for the analysis of transcriptomic data.
