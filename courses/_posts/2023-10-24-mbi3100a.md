General topics in medical bioinformatics, including public databases, bioinformatic data formats, sequence comparison and alignment, and next-generation sequence processing (mapping, de novo assembly). Labs introduce the command line interface, working within the Linux filesystem, and basic concepts in utilizing open source assets, batch processing and the implementation of bioinformatic workflows.
