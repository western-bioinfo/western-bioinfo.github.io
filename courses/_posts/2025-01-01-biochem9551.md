Artificial Intelligence for Medicine provides the basic knowledge necessary for students to pursue
biomedical research using machine-learning methods. The course will focus on concepts necessary for
applying machine learning to multiomic high-throughput data and their applications to topics relevant to
human health. This is a graduate-level course offered by Western University through the Department of
Biochemistry. This course is suitable for life sciences students with interests in applying machine learning
in analyses of omics data sets (e.g. next-generation DNA and RNA sequence, epigenetic data,
proteomic) or students with a background in statistics, mathematics or computer science/engineering
interested in developing new methods for the analysis of omics data.
