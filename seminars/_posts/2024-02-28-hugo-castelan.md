## Speaker biography

Hugo Castelán Sánchez, Mexican research, graduated from the National Autonomous
University of Mexico (UNAM) with a degree in Pharmaceutical-Biological Chemistry. He
earned a Master’s in Genomic Sciences from the Autonomous University of Mexico City
(UACM) and a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the Autonomous University of
Morelos (UAEM), where he focused on metagenomes and viromes in   extreme
environments.  His expertise includes molecular evolution, viral diversity, and
bioinformatics. He is a member of the Mexican Society of Virology and the Mexican
Genomic Surveillance Consortium. Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Associate in Poon’s
Lab at Western University, Canada.
