## Learning objectives

1. Statistical theorems prefer larger sample, and indicate that they will not inflate false positive rates, but why are there so many complains from applied researchers?
2. How reliable are the p-values provided by current differential expression analysis of large sample genomic data?
3. Our solution: distribution free and dynamic model complexity.
