## Learning objectives

* Highlight the use of deep learning, specifically VAEs, for integrating high-dimensional multi-omic data
* Present a novel multimodal framework for identifying distinct clusters in patients
* Explore the application of machine learning models to predict pain and functional outcomes using multimodal data
* Demonstrate the potential of advanced multimodal approaches for uncovering meaningful insights in healthcare research

## Speaker biography
