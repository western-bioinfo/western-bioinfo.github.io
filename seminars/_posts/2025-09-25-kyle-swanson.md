## Learning objectives
* Understand the concept of human-AI collaboration in scientific research
* Explore the design of the Virtual Lab framework and its AI agent architecture
* Examine how human guidance shapes AI-driven discovery processes
* Learn from a case study applying the Virtual Lab to identify SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders

## Speaker biography
Kyle is a PhD student in computer science at Stanford University advised by Prof. James Zou. He was previously at MIT, the University of Cambridge, and Imperial College London. His research is focused on building generative AI models for drug discovery. This includes both generative models for small molecule drug design (SyntheMol) as well as AI agents for antibody/nanobody drug design (Virtual Lab). His research bridges the gap between computational design and experimental validation and has included applications in antibacterial and antiviral drug discovery.
