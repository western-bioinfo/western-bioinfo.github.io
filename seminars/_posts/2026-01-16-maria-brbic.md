## Learning objectives
* Introduce generative AI methods designed to uncover and model the complex relationships between different molecular layers (omics) in biology.
* Demonstrate specific applications, such as digitally reassembling tissues from single cells and linking cellular morphology to gene expression data.
* Conclude with a methodology for building effective multi-modal AI models even when paired training data is scarce
