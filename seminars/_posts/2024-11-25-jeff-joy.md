## Learning objectives
* Understand the factors driving the emergence of pandemics
* Describe early global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it's introduction to Canada
* Be able to explain the interaction between pandemics and impacts on public health
* Describe the  burgeoning outbreak of H5N1 in North America

## Speaker biography
Dr. Joy is a Senior Research Scientist at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, he leads the Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics laboratory and is Assistant Professor of Medicine at UBC. Dr. Joyâ€™s work focuses on understanding the dynamics and drivers of viral evolution in pathogens of current concern such as HIV,HCV,and SARS-CoV-2, within-host viral evolution, dynamics of HIV cellular reservoirs, evaluating impacts of public health interventions on viral spread, and development of novel methods for understanding epidemic dynamics based on sequence data. His research interests include evolutionary epidemiology, virus evolution, phylogenetics, population genetics, molecular evolution, and bioinformatics.
