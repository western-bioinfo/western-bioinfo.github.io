## Speaker biography

Dr. Yang-Yu Liu received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2009. Following his doctorate, he embarked on a postdoctoral research fellowship, progressing to a research assistant professorship at Northeastern University from 2009 to 2012. In 2013, Dr. Liu started his own lab (https://yangyuliu.bwh.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital. His research integrates community ecology, network science, control theory, and machine learning to address fundamental questions about the human microbiome and explore their potential implications in disease treatment and precision nutrition.
