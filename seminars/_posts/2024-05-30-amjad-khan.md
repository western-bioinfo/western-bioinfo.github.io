## Learning objectives
- How to use differential equations to model the evolution of proviruses within bacterial genomes
- What types of genes are retained in defective prophages and why?
- Complementing bioinformatics analysis with modeling can help us develop more informed models.

## Speaker biography

Dr. Amjad Khan is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Poon lab at Western University.  He previously completed a doctoral dissertation in Applied Mathematics on the dynamics and evolution of prophage in bacterial genomes with Dr. Lindi Wahl at Western University, and subsequently worked with Dr. Robert Beiko at Dalhousie University as a postdoctoral fellow.
