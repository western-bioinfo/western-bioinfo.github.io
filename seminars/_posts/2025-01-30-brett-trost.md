## Learning objectives

* Understand why whole-genome sequencing data is necessary to fully understand the genetics of autism.
* Describe the roles of different types of genetic variation in the etiology of autism.
* Understand why autism polygenic risk scores should be interpreted with caution and are currently not informative at the level of individuals or families.

## Speaker biography

Brett completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, where he developed computational and statistical methods for studying phosphorylation-mediated cellular signaling. Subsequently, he was a Research Fellow at The Centre for Applied Genomics at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), where he used whole-genome sequencing data to study the genomic architecture of autism spectrum disorder. Brett joined the Molecular Medicine Program at SickKids as a Scientist in 2023, where he is interested in developing machine learning and multi-omics approaches to better understanding the role of genetics in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.
