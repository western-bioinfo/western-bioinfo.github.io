## Speaker biography

Sarah Gagliano Taliun is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Neurosciences at the Université de Montréal, and she leads a computational genetics research group at the Research Centre of the Montreal Heart Institute. Dr. Gagliano Taliun completed her PhD at the University of Toronto, and a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan before starting her research group at the Université de Montréal in 2020. Her research group uses computational methods to identify genetic contributors for complex human traits. She holds a Junior 2 salary award from the FRQS, as well as funding from CIHR.
