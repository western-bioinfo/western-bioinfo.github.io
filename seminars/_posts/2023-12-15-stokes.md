## Learning outcomes


## Speaker bio

Jon received his BHSc in 2011 and his PhD in antimicrobial chemical biology in 2016, both from McMaster University. From 2017â€“2021 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, carrying a prestigious Banting Fellowship. Upon completing his postdoc, Jon established his laboratory back at McMaster in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences. The Stokes Lab leverages a balance of experimental and computational approaches to discover the next generation of life-saving drugs with novel structures and functions. One of their primary interests, quite broadly, is in the development and implementation of deep learning algorithms to de novo design novel antibiotics.
