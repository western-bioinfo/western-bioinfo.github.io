## Learning objectives
* Background on the virus-host conflict
* The use of predicted structures to determine the function of viral proteins
* Identification of a pan-viral mechanism of anti-immunity

## Speaker biography

Dr. Jason Nomburg received in Ph.D. in Virology from Harvard in 2022, where he led efforts to use sequencing approaches to understand host-pathogen interactions. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in Jennifer Doudnaâ€™s lab at the Gladstone Institutes. Jason uses innovative structure-based bioinformatics methods to study viral proteins, with a special interest in proteins used by viruses to subvert cellular immunity.
