## Learning objectives
- Evaluating the emergent causal reasoning capabilities and limitations of modern LLMs across diverse domains.
- Enhancing LLMs causal inference by guiding them through structured, step by step formal methodologies.
- Exploring how individual causality scales to group outcomes and whether LLMs learn cooperation in multi-agent simulations.
