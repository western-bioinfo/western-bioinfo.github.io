## Speaker biography

Ilia is a PhD student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) co-advised by Prof. Bruno Correia and Prof. Michael Bronstein, and a fellow of the EPFLglobaLeaders program. Ilia's research interests lie in geometric learning and its applications in biology and chemistry, with focus on generative AI for drug discovery. Ilia earned his BS in Applied Mathematics and Physics, and MS in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Additionally, he completed the M2 program in Science in Industrial and Applied Mathematics (MSIAM) at Université Grenoble Alpes.
