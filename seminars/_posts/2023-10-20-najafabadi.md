### Learning objectives
- Overview computational methods developed by our lab to study RNA splicing and degradation using RNA sequencing;
- Describe how these methods can be used to uncover regulatory factors whose functions are disrupted in human diseases;
- Present some of our most recent work on extending these approaches to analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data.

### Speaker Bio

Dr. Hamed Najafabadi obtained his PhD from McGill University in 2012, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship in University of Toronto. He joined McGill University as a faculty member in 2016, where he is now an Associate Professor of Human Genetics and holds a Canada Research Chair in Systems Biology of Gene Regulation. His lab uses data-driven computational methods to characterize the role of gene regulatory factors in determining cell identity and function, and combines them with patient omics data to uncover the basis for development and progression of cancer.
