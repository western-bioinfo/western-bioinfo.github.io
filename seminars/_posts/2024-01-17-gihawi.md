## Speaker bio

Abraham Gihawi is a research fellow in the cancer genetics laboratory at the University of East Anglia, Norwich (UK). He undertook his PhD in computational biology under the supervision of Professor Daniel Brewer, benchmarking and applying pipelines for identifying microbes in human tissue whole genome sequence data. This included searching for microbes in Genomics Englandâ€™s 100,000 Genomes Project. More recently he has focused on bacteria and viruses associated with prostate cancer which is now the topic of his current position.
