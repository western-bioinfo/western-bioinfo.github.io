## Learning Objectives
* Summarize recent methodological developments in polygenic score 
(PGS) research
* Identify the caveats and limitations of existing approaches to PGS 
analysis of complex traits
* Plan ways to improve the diversity and inclusion in study designs of 
human genetics studies

## Speaker Bio
Dr. Yosuke Tanigawa is a postdoctoral at MIT’s Computational Biology Lab and develops 
statistical and computational methods for disease heterogeneity dissection, polygenic risk 
modeling, and therapeutic target discovery. He holds PhD in Biomedical Informatics from 
Stanford University and BS from the University of Tokyo. His recent works focus on the cellular 
and molecular basis of disease heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease and inclusive polygenic 
scores. He has received many awards for his research, including the Charles J. Epstein Trainee
Award from the American Society of Human Genetics and MIT Technology Review’s Innovators
Under 35 Japan Award. Personal website: https://yosuketanigawa.com/
