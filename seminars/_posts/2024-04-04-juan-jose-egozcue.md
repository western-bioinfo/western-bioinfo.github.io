## Speaker bio:
Dr. Juan José Egozcue studied Physics and was graduated in 1976 (Barcelona Univ., Spain) and got PhD in 1982. He was lecturer, associated professor and full professor at Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) in the period 1978-2016, teaching subjects in applied mathematics and statistics.
His research was initially focused to hazard analysis and Bayesian statistics. He started research on Compositional Data Analysis about 2000 in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Vera Pawlowsky-Glahn. Along the period 2000-2024 many articles on Compositional Data Analysis have been published and some of them are recognized as an important contribution to the development of this field.
