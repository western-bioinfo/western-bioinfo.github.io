## Speaker biography

Dr. Jiarui Ding is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at UBC. He is a Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Single-cell Analysis. He received his Ph.D. from UBC in 2016, under the guidance of Drs. Sohrab Shah and Anne Condon, and from 2017 to 2021, he performed postdoctoral training under Dr. Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute. His lab develops interpretable machine learning models and efficient inference algorithms for multi-modality data analysis, to elucidate the cellular and molecular features in tissue homeostasis and inflammation, and help to reveal the general principles of tissue cellular organization.
