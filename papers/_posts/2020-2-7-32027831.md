# Abstract

In a recent issue of Cell, Satterstrom etÂ al. leverage de novo high-impact variants to identify 102 genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of these genes have roles in regulation of gene expression or neuronal communication, implicating both developmental and functional changes in ASD.
