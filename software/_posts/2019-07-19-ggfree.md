# ggfree: ggplot2-style plots with just base R graphics

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a popular R graphics
package that is becoming synonymous with data visualization in R. The
community of developers working within the `ggplot2` framework have
implemented some [rather nice
extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) as well. However, it
is almost always possible for a visualization produced in `ggplot2` to
also be generated using the base graphics package in R. Long-time users
of R who are accustomed to building plots with the latter may find the
syntax of `ggplot2` counter-intuitive and awkward.

The overall purpose of `ggfree` is to make it easier to generate plots
in the style of [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and its
extensions, without ever actually using any ggplot2 code.

## Installation

-   `ggfree` requires the package
    [`ape`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html),
    which you can install by running the command
    `install.packages('ape')` within R.

-   The simplest way to install `ggfree` is to download this package and
    then install it on the command line. You can use the GitHub web
    interface to download the latest version of this package as a ZIP
    archive, by clicking on the green *Code* button and then selecting
    the *Download ZIP* option on the contextual menu that appears. If
    you have the [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) version control program
    installed on your computer, then you can navigate to the desired
    location in your filesystem and run the command:
    `git clone https://github.com/ArtPoon/ggfree`

    In either case, navigate to the `ggfree` directory in your Terminal
    app and run the command:

    ``` console
    art@Wernstrom ggfree % R CMD INSTALL .
    * installing to library ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library’
    ```

-   You can also use the
    [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
    package to install `ggfree` within R. If you already have `devtools`
    installed in your R environment, then you can simply run:

    ``` r
    # install.packages('devtools')  # if you haven't already installed devtools
    require(devtools)
    devtools::install_github("ArtPoon/ggfree")
    ```

    However, `devtools` is a large R package with many dependencies, so
    I don’t recommend this method if you haven’t already installed it.
