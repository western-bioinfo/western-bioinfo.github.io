Gromstole is collection of Python and R scripts to estimate the relative frequencies of different SARS-CoV-2 [lineages](https://cov-lineages.org/), including specific "variants of concern", from next-generation sequence data (FASTQ) derived from wastewater samples.  This includes:
* a wrapper script (`minimap2.py`) to rapidly stream output from the reference mapping program [minimap](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) to extract coverage and mutation frequency statistics for each sample;
* an R script (`estimate-freqs.R`) that uses quasibinomial regression to estimate the frequency of a variant of concern from the frequencies of mutations based on the associated [constellation file](https://github.com/cov-lineages/constellations/)
* a second R script (`make-barplots.R`) for visualizing these variant frequency estimates across a set of samples as a barplot


## Dependencies
* [cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt) 1.18+
* [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) version 2.17+
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6+
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Usage

The following summarizes a workflow based on a pair of FASTQ files associated with a [study of wastewater by the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP354147).  These data can be obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive using the command line tool `fasterq-dump` that is distributed with the [sra-tools](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools) package.

The `consellations` submodule needs to be initialized prior to running the scripts for the first time. 

```console
git submodule init; git submodule update
```

Prior to running the scripts, the submodule should be updated to use the latest constellation JSON files.

```console
git submodule foreach git pull origin main
```

```console

## Description

Our current modelling strategy consists of a quasibinomial GLM for the count and coverage of the mutations that define a VOC, which are parsed from constellation JSON files curated by [cov-lineages](https://github.com/cov-lineages/constellations/).

The script `minimap2.py` currently accepts paired-end reads in separate FASTQ files and outputs `[prefix]-mapped.csv` and `[prefix]-coverage.csv` into the specified output directory. It uses `data/NC043312.fa` as a reference genome, but an alternative FASTA file can be specified by the user.  By default, it uses cutadapt to trim adapter sequences from the data.

Use `python3 scripts/minimap2.py -h` to see all of the options.

```sh
python3 scripts/minimap2.py r1.fastq r2.fastq --outdir results --prefix name-of-sample
```

Given a directory containing one or more subdirectories that each contain paired-end Illumina FASTQ fiiles, the following R script runs the binomial regression and outputs a json file that contains all relevant information:

- the counts of each mutation of the `lineages/` file
- the coverage at every position on the reference genome, 
- the metadata that was used as input (optional), 
- the estimate of the proportion (including 95% confidence interval), 
- the lineage name, and 
- the name of the input directory.

```sh
Rscript scripts/estimate-freqs.R results/name-of-sample constellations/constellations/definitions/cBA.1.csv results/outfile.json path/to/metadata.csv
```
