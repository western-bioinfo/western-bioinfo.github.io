# Poplars

*Poplars* is a collection of open-source implementations of popular tools from [Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html) (LANL), which is an important web resource for researchers in HIV/AIDS that curates published sequence data and online tools for processing these data.  Los &Aacute;lamos is "the cottonwoods" in Spanish [[source](https://books.google.ca/books?id=p3fMJnT1gx0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q=alamos&f=false)], and cottonwoods are a common name for [poplars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus).

## Available Tools 

Implementations of the following tools are currently available:
* Hypermut
* Rip-like
* Sequence locator 

## Dependencies 

#### Python Requiremnts 

*Poplars* requires [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/). 

*Poplars* was tested using Python 3.6.x and Python 2.7x and is compatible with all major versions of Python.

*Poplars* uses MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) for sequence alignment, so for ease of use we have distributed all-in-one MAFFT packages for Linux (MAFFT Version 7.427), Windows  (MAFFT Version 7.429), and Mac OS X (MAFFT 7.427). 

#### Operating System Requirements 
*Poplars* is compatible with:
* Windows 10
* Linux 
* Mac OS X (Mac OS X 10.5-10.14, x86 only)

*Poplars* was tested on Windows 10 Version 1903, Ubuntu 18.04.2, and Mac OS X Mavericks.

## Installation 
*Poplars* can be installed directly from the source code on GitHub or through the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) `pip`. 

#### From Source 
1. Navigate to your directory of choice. Then clone the *Poplars* repository by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/PoonLab/Poplars.git
    ``` 
    Alternatively, you can download *Poplars* into your directory of choice.  

2. After downloading or cloning the repository, a directory called *Poplars* will be created in your working directory. Navigate to the *Poplars* folder and run `setup.py` in your terminal using one of the following commands: 
    ```commandline
    sudo python setup.py install 
    ```
    or 
    ```commandline
    sudo python3 setup.py install
    ```

    `setup.py` will install *Poplars* along with MAFFT binaries (executables) that are specific to your machine. 
    
    *Poplars* will be installed into your Python site-packages (so you can use *Poplars* anywhere you can use Python!)

#### Using `pip` 
1. To install *Poplars*, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```commandline
    pip install poplars
    ```
